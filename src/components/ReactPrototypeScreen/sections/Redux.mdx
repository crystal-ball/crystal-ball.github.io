# Redux

_Best practices for working with Redux_

- Separate action constants to a separate file in dux slice so that they can be imported
  into other slices without worrying about circular dependencies. Try to never use actions
  or selectors in other slices and instead listen for appropriate action dispatches. Try to
  get slices of state in components and then combine into a complex memoized selector for
  fns that need state from multiple slices.
