# Redux

_Best practices for working with Redux_

- Separate action constants to a separate file in dux slice so that they can be imported
  into other slices without worrying about circular dependencies. Try to never use actions
  or selectors in other slices and instead listen for appropriate action dispatches. Try
  to get slices of state in components and then combine into a complex memoized selector
  for fns that need state from multiple slices.

## Naming conventions

- Action types: Name as _nounVerb_, eg `LOCATION_UPDATED`, this encourages thinking of
  actions as reports that can be listened to in any reducer, and responded to as
  appropriate.
- Action creators: Name as _verbNoun_, eg `updateLocation`, this helps provide context on
  what an action is doing when it is dispatched.

## Other conventions

- Try to keep state types consistent, eg if it's defaulting a value to `''` makes sense
  instead of `null`, that's great because the type doesn't change.
- JSDoc type fields with what they _represent_, and if necessary, how they should be used.
- Define action types as a separate module _always_ to make it easy to import them into
  other slices without creating circular dependencies.

Define: Redux as a state machine: With any reducer, what are the _finite_ states that can
be modeled, and what are the legal _transitions_ between those states? Include this in the
reducer to prevent bugs like transitioning from error directly to success...

## Reducers as state machines

Setup reducers to determine the next state based on the received event AND the current
state of the slice:

```javascript
const initialState = {
  status: 'idle' // Finite state being one of 'idle', 'loading', 'sucess',
  packages: []
}

function idleReducer(state, action) {
  // ... Handle transitions that can occur when idle
}

function loadingReducer(state, action) {
  // ... Handle transitions that can occur when loading
}

export default function reducer (state= initialState, action) {
  switch(state.status) {
    case 'idle': {
      return idleReducer(state, action)
    }
    case 'loading': {
      return loadingReducer(state,action)
    }

    // ... etc. for each of the finite states possible in this reducer
  }
}
```
