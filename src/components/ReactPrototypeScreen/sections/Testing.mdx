# Applications testing

- Focus unit testing on pure fns in the codebase, especially Redux and transform fns. This
  provides coverage of business logic without requiring as much setup and mocking as
  testing application components/features.
- Enforce code coverage with Jest, especially for Redux store -> Shoot for 100%!
