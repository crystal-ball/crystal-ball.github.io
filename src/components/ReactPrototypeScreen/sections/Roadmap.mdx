## Roadmap

**Alerting**

_Setup a process for reporting application errors with alerting_

- Ability to report uncaught exceptions within the application
- ErrorBoundary components for gracefully recovering from failures
- Ability to report API contract failures

Plan to use Rollbar and report events directly to their API instead of using SDKs. A
single account could be used for Applications and Services.
