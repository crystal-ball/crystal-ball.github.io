## Routing

Routing is managed with Redux as a `routing` store slice.

1. Middleware `routingMiddleware` handles syncing the url whenever a routing action is
   dispatched.
1. Fns `parseSearchParams` and `stringifySearchParams` use the browser `URLSearchParams`
   API to handle search params
1. `Link` component provides a simple way to dispatch routing actions

1. Redux slice has `pathname` and `searchParams`

- Middleware resets scroll
- `Link` universal component prevents default behavior and dispatches Redux actions

Unlike many other routing solutions the route params and query params are not stored in
the store. The pathname is the single source of truth and is available with selectors and
can then be parsed with `path-to-regexp` or `qs`
