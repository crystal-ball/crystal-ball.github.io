## Code authoring

Code authoring processes automate code format, style and commit messages consistency to
make contributing to repos straightforward.

**Commitizen**

- Commit message contents are standardized with [Commitizen][] in order to use Semantic
  Release for automated package publishing by installing the
  [`@crystal-ball/commitizen-base`][] package and including the `package.json`
  configurations:

  ```json
  "config": {
    "commitizen": {
      "path": "@crystal-ball/commitizen-base"
    }
  },
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "prepare-commit-msg": "exec < /dev/tty && git cz --hook || true"
    }
  }
  ```

**ESLint**

- Statically analyzable code quality and style choices are automated with [ESLint][] by
  installing the [`eslint-config-eloquence`][] package and setting up `eslintrc.js`
  configs.

**Prettier**

- Consistently format code with [Prettier][] by installing the
  [`@crystal-ball/prettier-base`] package and including the `package.json` configurations.
- Skip formatting files that are auto-generated by including negating them in the package
  `format` script. Repos shouldn't need a `.prettierignore` file which helps cut down on
  the config files.

```json
"scripts": {
  "format": "prettier --write  '*.{js,json,md}' '**/*.{js,json,md,mdx,scss}' !CHANGELOG.md"
},
"prettier": "@crystal-ball/prettier-base"
```
