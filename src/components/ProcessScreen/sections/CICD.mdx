## CI/CD

Continuous integration and delivery workflows are only possible by putting in place
multiple high quality processes. Once in place they allow for truly fast, iterative
work... aka the dream. The end goal of CI/CD is to be able to quickly ship small changes
to production with confidence.

- Include linting and unit test scripts in each package.json for automating code quality
  checks.
- Check for formatting and code quality by linting files during testing with a `test:lint`
  package script that will check all module source files.

  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "test": "npm run test:lint && npm run test:unit",
    "test:lint": "NODE_ENV=test eslint --format=pretty src",
    "test:unit": "jest src"
  }
  ```

**Github actions**

1. Packages should have checks for:

- Github action
- Code Climate (maintainability check)
- LGTM
- Snyk

2. Applications should have checks for:

- Github action
- Code Climate (maintainability check)
- LGTM
- Snyk
- Zeit
- Cypress
- Percy

- Always use `npm ci` in CI/CD builds for apps/services to install from the package
  lockfile.
- The workflows for parsing out git/github info is still being stabilized. Due to running
  Github actions on pull requests, as well as spotty Gihub actions support, as well as
  Docker complications, it is sometimes required to explicitly set environment variables
  for tools. Easiest solution for this so far is to set environment variables to the _Pull
  Request_ branch and SHA info. Then in the step, set to fallbacks for runs on master:

  ```yaml
  - name: Code Climate - Report
    if: success()
    run: |
      # If this is a PR then GIT_BRANCH will be used, otherwise we pull `master` out of GITHUB_REF
      export GIT_BRANCH="${GIT_BRANCH:-${GITHUB_REF:11}}"
      ./cc-test-reporter after-build --prefix /usr/src/app
    env:
      # Setting the commit SHA will work on PRS and will point the test to the commit SHA
      # instead of the PR SHA
      GIT_COMMIT_SHA: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
      GIT_BRANCH: ${{ github.head_ref }}
      CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID: ${{ secrets.CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID }}
  ```

- [Code Climate environment variables](https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/github-actions-test-coverage)
- [Cypress environment variables](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/continuous-integration.html#Git-information)
- [Percy environment variables](https://docs.percy.io/docs/environment-variables)
- Structure of a CI/CD workflow to run on every pull request, and every push to master.

  ```yaml
  name: CI/CD

  on:
    # Run jobs on every pull request and pull request update
    pull_request:
      types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
    # Run jobs on pushes to master branch only
    push:
      branches:
        - master

  jobs:
    # Include a job specifically for `skip ci` commits otherwise Github will mark the run
    # as a failure, this is needed for packages using Semantic Release
    skip:
      name: CI Skip
      if: contains(github.event.head_commit.message, 'skip ci')
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Skip CI Commit
          run: echo "Skip CI commit succes

    # Run tests for all events (unless the commit message includes `skip ci`)
    test:
      name: Continuous Integration
      if: contains(github.event.head_commit.message, 'skip ci') == false

    # Run deployments/publishing only on push to master and only if the tests passed
    publish:
      name: Continuous Deployment
      needs: test
      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'
  ```

### [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/oss/dashboard)

_Code Climate provides reporting on some general code quality checks, and code coverage_

1. Code Climate will run a check on PRs and report on code maintainability issues, eg
   duplicated code.
1. After tests run CC will then add inline comments and a summary comment to the PR.

**Code Climate setup**

- Add the repo to the Code Coverage org, CC will automatically provide maintainability
  checks ðŸŽ‰
- In _Repo Settings -> Test coverage_ uncheck enforce diff and enforce code coverage. Code
  coverage levels should be enforced with Jest configs. The Code Coverage integration
  provides additional information, but should not be a critical path in reviews. The Code
  CClimate
- In _Repo Settings -> Github_:
  1. Enable PR Summary comments with 'Delete outdated comments and post a new one'
  1. Enable Inline issue comments, max of 5, with 'Post additional inline comments on new
     issues'
  1. Enable PR status updates
  1. SAVE!
- In _Repo Settings -> Exclude patterns_ add test files patterns to exclude test files
  from code coverage totals:

  ```
  cypress/
  **/*.spec.js
  ```

**Repo Setup**

- Add a `.codeclimate.yml` to the repo for fine tuning maintainability checks:
  1. `method-lines` should be 125 in React projects to account for function components,
     and 75 in Node projects. (Default is 25 lines! So short!!)

* When a repo has a `.codeclimate.yml` configuration file, then the file exclusions for
  maintainability checks need to be included as `exclude_patterns` in that config, any
  exclusions entered in the CC dashboard won't be applied!

```yml
# https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/advanced-configuration#section-default-check-configurations
version: '2'
checks:
  # Allow 75 lines in functions
  method-lines:
    config:
      threshold: 75
exclude_patterns:
  - 'cypress/'
  - '**/*.spec.js'
```

**Test coverage setup**

- In _Repo Settings -> Test coverage_ copy the **Test Reporter ID** and add it to the
  Github repo secrets as `CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID`
- Add `lcov` to `jest.config.js:coverageReporters` to output LCOV reports (these reports
  are sent to CC by the CC reporter)
- Add setup and reporting steps to CI workflow to send coverage results:

  ```yaml
  steps
    - name: Code Climate - Setup
      # Install the Code Climate reporter in workspace
      run: |
        curl -L https://codeclimate.com/downloads/test-reporter/test-reporter-latest-linux-amd64 > ./cc-test-reporter
        chmod +x ./cc-test-reporter
        ./cc-test-reporter before-build

    - name: Code Climate - Report
      if: success()
      # Upload test code coverage report to Code Climate (branch must be explicitly set)
      run: |
        export GIT_BRANCH="${GIT_BRANCH:-${GITHUB_REF:11}}"
        ./cc-test-reporter after-build
  ```

  _(See the Github actions section for details on git environment variables)_

- When reporting coverage that was generated inside a Docker container include a
  `--prefix` arg to the reporter matching the Docker workspace path. Eg if the tests ran
  at `/usr/src/app` then the call to the reporter should be:

  ```sh
  ./cc-test-reporter format-coverage --prefix /usr/src/app
  ```

**Cypress**

- Match the [React Application Prototype][react-prototype] Docker compose workflow to run
  the application for Cypress to test against.
  - Setup a `Dockerfile` to build and serve the app
  - Setup a `cypress/Dockerfile` to run the Cypress+Percy test commands
  - Setup `docker-compose{.ci}.yml` files to start and manage the app and test containers
- Add a `CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY` and `--record` for reporting to the Cypress dashboard.

- CYPRESS CODE COVERAGE:
  https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/code-coverage.html#Introduction

Cypress Github app settings:

- One check per run group
- PR comments enabled
- Include screenshots
-

**Percy**

- Setup the Percy package and configurations:
  - Install the dependency: `@percy/cypress`
  - Setup the healthcheck in `cypress/plugins/index.js`
  - Import command in `cypress/support/index.js`
- Add a `PERCY_TOKEN` env variable to test envs for reporting:
  - Get `PERCY_TOKEN` from Percy dashboard and add to CI/CD secrets
- Add a Dockerfile to `cypress` dir to manage installing additional testing dependencies
  for Cypress and overriding the run command to use Percy
- Use [Percy environment variables][] to indicate which branch is being tested. _(See the
  Github actions documentation for details on parsing out commit info during workflow
  runs)_
  - The Percy app isn't able to determine the branch for PRs or for Docker runs, Set a
    `PERCY_BRANCH` environment variable to fix.
- See the [Percy tutorials][] for example apps using Cypress and Storybook.

**Semantic Release**

- Install the `@crystal-ball/semantic-release-base` pacakge and include the `package.json`
  configuration

  ```json
  "release": {
    "extends": ["@crystal-ball/semantic-release-base"]
  }
  ```

- Configure Github actions to run `npx semantic-release` for master builds with successful
  test runs. Use the `if` to skip publish commits.

**Zeit**

- Match the [`now.json`][] configuration file maintained in the React Application
  Prototype.
  - The `build.env` variables increase npm install speed and limit console output.
    _([Cypress - Skipping Installation][cypress-installs])_
  - Include a route config for all resources to add a `cache-control` header for long term
    caching of webpack hashed build assets. _([Zeit configuration -
    headers][route-headers])_
  4. Add a route config that rewrites all requests to `/` to support single page app
     `index.html` resolution _([Zeit configuration - SPA Fallback][spa-fallback])_
  - The `routes` configurations add caching headers to all static assets and reroute all
    other requests to `index.html` for SPA routing.
- Set the `package.json#engines` field to `10` to configure the static builder to use the
  latest available version of Node.js. _([Static Build Project Node.js
  Version][builder-node-version])_
