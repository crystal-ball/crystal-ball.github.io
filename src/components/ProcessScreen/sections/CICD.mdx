## CI/CD

Continuous integration and delivery workflows are only possible by putting in place
multiple high quality processes. Once in place they allow for truly fast, iterative
work... aka the dream. The end goal of CI/CD is to be able to quickly ship small changes
to production with confidence.

- Include linting and unit test scripts in each package.json for automating code quality
  checks.
- Check for formatting and code quality by linting files during testing with a `test:lint`
  package script that will check all module source files.

  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "test": "npm run test:lint && npm run test:unit",
    "test:lint": "NODE_ENV=test eslint --format=pretty src",
    "test:unit": "jest src"
  }
  ```

**Github actions**

- Always use `npm ci` in CI/CD builds for apps/services to install from the package
  lockfile.
- Provide git commit info for Cypress+Percy: Because CI runs in Docker, on pull requests,
  Cypress+Percy are unable to determine the git info for the merge commit being tested and
  show _unknown_/`HEAD` as the branch. This is fixed by checking for a merging branch
  commit SHA in the `github` workflow context. If it exists it's used to determine the
  commit info for the test run, otherwise the Github Action workflow env variables contain
  the correct info for master branch pushes.
- Setup the CI/CD workflow to handle:

  ```
  name: CI/CD

  on:
    # Run jobs on every pull request
    pull_request:
      types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
    # Run jobs on pushes to master branch only
    push:
      branches:
        - master

  jobs:
    # Include a job specifically for `skip ci` commits otherwise Github will mark the run
    # as a failure
    skip:
      name: CI Skip
      if: contains(github.event.head_commit.message, 'skip ci')
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Skip CI Commit
          run: echo "Skip CI commit succes
    # Run tests unless the commit message includes `skip ci`
    test:
      name: Continuous Integration
      if: contains(github.event.head_commit.message, 'skip ci') == false
    publish:
      name: Continuous Deployment
      # Only run the Semantic Release publish job if the test job passes
      needs: test
      # Only run on publish on master
      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'
  ```

**[Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/oss/dashboard)**

- Adding a repo to the Code Coverage org will automatically provide maintainability
  coverage ðŸŽ‰
- Setup code coverage reporting:

  - Add a `CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID` Github secret `/settings/test_reporter/` Code Climate
    dashboard.
  - Output `lcov` code coverage reports from Jest
  - Add setup and report steps to CI workflow to install and call the Code Climate
    reporter.

- When reporting coverage that was generated inside a Docker container include a
  `--prefix` arg to the reporter matching the Docker workspace path. Eg if the tests ran
  at `/usr/src/app` then the call to the reporter would need to be:

  ```sh
  cc-test-reporter format-coverage --prefix /usr/src/app
  ```

- In Code Climate dashboard's _Repo Settings_, _Exclude patterns_ add test files patterns
  to exclude test files from code coverage totals:

  ```
  cypress/
  **/*.spec.js
  ```

**Cypress**

- Match the [React Application Prototype][react-prototype] Docker compose workflow to run
  the application for Cypress to test against.
  - Setup a `Dockerfile` to build and serve the app
  - Setup a `cypress/Dockerfile` to run the Cypress+Percy test commands
  - Setup `docker-compose{.ci}.yml` files to start and manage the app and test containers
- Add a `CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY` and `--record` for reporting to the Cypress dashboard.

**Percy**

- Setup the Percy package and configurations:
  - Install the dependency: `@percy/cypress`
  - Setup the healthcheck in `cypress/plugins/index.js`
  - Import command in `cypress/support/index.js`
- Add a `PERCY_TOKEN` env variable to test envs for reporting:
  - Get `PERCY_TOKEN` from Percy dashboard and add to CI/CD secrets
- Add a Dockerfile to `cypress` dir to manage installing additional testing dependencies
  for Cypress and overriding the run command to use Percy
- Use [Percy environment variables][] to indicate which branch is being tested. _(See the
  Github actions documentation for details on parsing out commit info during workflow
  runs)_
  - The Percy app isn't able to determine the branch for PRs or for Docker runs, Set a
    `PERCY_BRANCH` environment variable to fix.
- See the [Percy tutorials][] for example apps using Cypress and Storybook.

**Semantic Release**

- Install the `@crystal-ball/semantic-release-base` pacakge and include the `package.json`
  configuration

  ```json
  "release": {
    "extends": ["@crystal-ball/semantic-release-base"]
  }
  ```

- Configure Github actions to run `npx semantic-release` for master builds with successful
  test runs. Use the `if` to skip publish commits.

**Zeit**

- Match the [`now.json`][] configuration file maintained in the React Application
  Prototype.
  - The `build.env` variables increase npm install speed and limit console output.
    _([Cypress - Skipping Installation][cypress-installs])_
  - Include a route config for all resources to add a `cache-control` header for long term
    caching of webpack hashed build assets. _([Zeit configuration -
    headers][route-headers])_
  4. Add a route config that rewrites all requests to `/` to support single page app
     `index.html` resolution _([Zeit configuration - SPA Fallback][spa-fallback])_
  - The `routes` configurations add caching headers to all static assets and reroute all
    other requests to `index.html` for SPA routing.
- Set the `package.json#engines` field to `10` to configure the static builder to use the
  latest available version of Node.js. _([Static Build Project Node.js
  Version][builder-node-version])_
