## Repository management

Github repository management includes using templates to automatically include community
health files and optimizing repository issue and merge settings.

**Github**

- Consistently use labels for grouping issues across repositories by using the issue
  labels script in `scripts/create-github-labels.js`
- Declutter repository header tabs by disabling wikis and projects in the
  _Settings.Options:Features_ settings. Documentation should be maintained in a `/docs`
  directory and project management should use ZenHub releases and projects.
- Keep a streamlined git history by disabling merge commits and rebase merging in the
  _Settings.Options:Merge Button_ settings.
- Keep branches cleaned up by enabling automatically deleting head branches in the
  _Settings.Options:Merge Button_ settings.
- Only define needed configuration files by using the shared issue and pull request
  templates defined in the [.github][] template repository.
- Provide details on how to contribute with a contributing guide in
  `.github/contributing.md`. Include a guide in each repo so that additional notes can be
  added for the design of that specific repository.
- Support community health by including a copy of the Contributor Covenant code of conduct
  in the repository root. _(Although it's possible to include a code of conduct in the
  .github template repository, it should be included in each repo root for visibility
  because it's important)_
- Keep the project Readme focused on providing an overview of the project and workflows,
  details can be documented in a guide.
- Project guides or detailed code documentation should be kept in guides in the `docs`
  dir.

**ZenHub**

1. Add new repositories to a ZenHub board

**Slack**

Create a Slack channel for each repository and subsribe to deployments and releases.

- Reminders for open PRs are posted in #reminders and configured as a Github 'Scheduled
  Reminder' in the CBC org settings:
  https://github.com/organizations/crystal-ball/settings/reminders
- Personal notifications are posted in the Github app channel as a Github 'Scheduled
  Reminder' configured for personal account:
  https://github.com/settings/reminders/crystal-ball

...getting notifications in Slack channels by repo ðŸš§

- [Github][github slack app] with `/github subscribe crystal-ball/repo-name`

* [Github Slack app](https://slack.github.com/)

### Github for Slack

- Bot won't work for private repositories until you sign in with `/github signin`
- CBC whitelists which repos Slack can access:
  (https://github.com/organizations/crystal-ball/settings/installations)
- Subscribe to: Deployments and Releases:
  `/github subscribe crystal-ball/<REPO> deployments releases`
