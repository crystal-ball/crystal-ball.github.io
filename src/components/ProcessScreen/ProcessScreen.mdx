# Process

Small modules are easier to create, test, and use, but each module also has a maintenance
cost. Modern modules automate as much of the module _infrastructure_ as possible to
minimize the cost of keeping modules up to date.

## Repository management

Github repository management includes using templates to automatically include community
health files and optimizing repository issue and merge settings.

**Github**

- Consistently use labels for grouping issues across repositories by using the issue
  labels script in `scripts/create-github-labels.js`
- Declutter repository header tabs by disabling wikis and projects in the
  _Settings.Options:Features_ settings. Documentation should be maintained in a `/docs`
  directory and project management should use ZenHub releases and projects.
- Keep a streamlined git history by disabling merge commits and rebase merging in the
  _Settings.Options:Merge Button_ settings.
- Keep branches cleaned up by enabling automatically deleting head branches in the
  _Settings.Options:Merge Button_ settings.
- Only define needed configuration files by using the shared issue and pull request
  templates defined in the [.github][] template repository.
- Provide details on how to contribute with a contributing guide in
  `.github/contributing.md`. Include a guide in each repo so that additional notes can be
  added for the design of that specific repository.
- Support community health by including a copy of the Contributor Covenant code of conduct
  in the repository root. _(Although it's possible to include a code of conduct in the
  .github template repository, it should be included in each repo root for visibility
  because it's important)_

## Dependencies management

Updating module dependencies automatically cuts down on one of the primary maintenance
burdens of modules, and helps keep vulnerabilities out of upstream projects. A rolling
Renovate schedule is setup to update code authoring packages, then tools packages, then
prototypes and finally apps/services.

#### Package dependencies semver

Packages should use minor ranges for any dependencies that might also be included by other
packages to prevent multiple versions being required _(eg if `nanoid` is a dependency it
should be specified with a `^` range)_. Dependencies that are explicitly managed by that
package can be pinned for better version control _(eg the `@crystal-ball/webpack-base`
package should pin the `webpack` dependency)_.

#### Monitoring dependency vulnerabilities

Dependencies are monitered for vulnerabilities with [Snyk][]. The Github integration will
include a check for all PRs to notify if the change introduces any new high severity
vulnerabilities.

**Renovate**

- Repository access for the Renovate Github app is configured in the [Github org installed
  apps settings][installed-apps]. After a repo is added to Renovate it will open a
  configuration setup PR.
- Renovate configurations should match the [Renovate configuration][renovate.json]
  maintained in this repository.
  - The `commitMessageTopic` should be customized to either `application`, `service` or
    `package` depending on the repository.
  - The `schedule` should be set to match the repository type.
- A master issue is created for each repo just for funesies and all Renovate PRs are
  labeled with the `Renovate` label.
- Updates for dependencies and devDependencies are separated in order to prevent
  publishing new package versions for development+testing dependency updates.
- Config `separateMajorMinor` is left `false` to provide higher visibility for updates
  with major version bumps. It is also possible to delay a major version update if
  necessary (eg when waiting for community Babel support).
- Package dependency resolution happens at build time by not including lock files. This is
  meant to provide more realistic testing during CI/CD by mirroring how the package
  dependencies will be resolved when installed by a consumer.
- Updates are rolled upstream through the week by updating on a rolling schedule:
  - Monday: Authoring tools (eg semantic-release-base, commitizen-base, prettier-base)
  - Tuesday: Development toolsets (eg webpack-base, svg-symbol-sprite-loader)
  - Wednesday: Prototypes (eg react-application-prototype)
  - Thursday: Projects (eg gitpush-f, hecka-rad)

**Snyk**

- Configurations are managed in the [Snyk dashboard][]
- Vulnerabilities reporting and badge info is available in the [Snyk dashboard][]
- Automated security fix PRs are currently disabled due to confusion of how they are
  applied.

**npm**

- Dependency version change visibility is increased by pinning all versions in each
  `package.json`.
- Project dependency resolution is locked across builds by including lock files.
- npm install behavior is configured with an `.npmrc`

  ```
  save-exact=true
  # Package lock files disabled:
  package-lock=false
  ```

## Code authoring

Code authoring processes automate code format, style and commit messages consistency to
make contributing to repos straightforward.

**Commitizen**

- Commit message contents are standardized with [Commitizen][] in order to use Semantic
  Release for automated package publishing by installing the
  [`@crystal-ball/commitizen-base`][] package and including the `package.json`
  configurations:

  ```json
  "config": {
    "commitizen": {
      "path": "@crystal-ball/commitizen-base"
    }
  },
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "prepare-commit-msg": "exec < /dev/tty && git cz --hook || true"
    }
  }
  ```

**ESLint**

- Statically analyzable code quality and style choices are automated with [ESLint][] by
  installing the [`eslint-config-eloquence`][] package and setting up `eslintrc.js`
  configs.

**Prettier**

- Consistently format code with [Prettier][] by installing the
  [`@crystal-ball/prettier-base`] package and including the `package.json` configurations:

  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "format": "prettier --write '*.{md,js,json,yml}' '{.storybook,docs,cypress,src,test}/**/*.{html,md,js,scss}'"
  },
  "prettier": "@crystal-ball/prettier-base"
  ```

- Design custom badges using [Shields IO](https://shields.io/).
- Include logos from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org) for badges with integrations.

## Project management

- Keep the ZenHub board relevant and easy to work within by documenting long term
  repository goals and ideas in the _Roadmap_ section of the Contributing doc.

<!-- Editing finished -->

# Continuous Integration and Deployment

_Configure github actions for each repo to handle testing each pull request and deploying
on change to master._

## Continous integration

- Always use `npm ci` in CI/CD builds for apps/services to install from the package
  lockfile.
- Github action configuration
- Zeit for applications
- Should build and run tests for each PR

## Continuous deployment

- Github action configuration
- Should use Semantic Release for publishing npm packages. Include package.json release
  field to configure:

  ```json
  {
    "release": {
      "extends": ["@crystal-ball/semantic-release-base"]
    }
  }
  ```

## Providing commit info for Cypress+Percy

Because CI runs in Docker, on pull requests, Cypress+Percy are unable to determine the git
info for the merge commit being tested and show _unknown_/`HEAD` as the branch. This is
fixed by checking for a merging branch commit SHA in the `github` workflow context. If it
exists it's used to determine the commit info for the test run, otherwise the Github
Action workflow env variables contain the correct info for master branch pushes.

# Releases

!Make it automated

Docs on setting up automated releases with semantic

In CI run: `npx semantic-release`

Include semantic-release-base config in `package.json`

```
{
  "release": {
    "extends": ["@crystal-ball/semantic-release-base"]
  }
}
```

#### Github Actions

...TODO

# Writing documentation

- Keep the project Readme focused on providing an overview of the project and workflows,
  details can be documented in a guide.
- Project guides or detailed code documentation should be kept in guides in the `docs`
  dir.

## Integrations

### Code Climate

_Integration with Code Climate provides fun visuals for project code coverage and some
general maintainability best practices._

- https://codeclimate.com/oss/dashboard

#### Setup

Adding a repo to the Code Coverage org will automatically provide maintainability coverage
🎉 Add code coverage by:

1. In Code Climate dashboard's _Repo Settings_, _Exclude patterns_ add test files patterns
   to exclude test files from code coverage totals
   ```
   cypress/
   **/*.spec.js
   ```

- Output `lcov` code coverage reports from Jest
- Add a `CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID` env var to Travis from the `/settings/test_reporter/` Code
  Climate dashboard.
- Add `before_script` and `after_script` lifecycles to `.travis.yml` to install and call
  the Code Climate reporter.
- Add the badges!

#### Working with Docker containers

Code coverage from tests run inside of a Docker container need to have the path included
when reporting the results. Eg if the tests ran at `/usr/src/app` then the call to the
reporter would need to be:

- `cc-test-reporter format-coverage --prefix /usr/src/app --exit-code $TRAVIS_TEST_RESULT`

> ℹ️ `--exit-code` prevents sending test coverage for failed tests

### Cypress

<div align='center'>
  <em>Cypress provides fun! end to end testing for React applications 🎉</em>
</div>

- https://dashboard.cypress.io/

- CI HANDLING REPORTING TO PROJECT DASHBOARD OF RESULTS
- USING DOCKER COMPOSE AND INCLUDED IMAGE FOR FASTER RUNS
- TRAVIS ENV VARIABLE AND REPORTER FLAGS

#### CI Workflow

**Better?**

- Is there a way to conditionally include the `--record` flag and record key for CI runs
  without using a separate Compose file

#### Badge

```html
<a href="https://dashboard.cypress.io/#/projects/PROJECT-ID/runs">
  <img
    src="https://img.shields.io/badge/cypress-dashboard-brightgreen.svg"
    alt="Cypress Dashboard"

# MDX

MDX operates by parsing the markdown into an AST using [remark][] and then generating HTML
from the AST using [rehype][]. remark and rehype are part of the [unifiedjs][] collective

### Setup

1. Install and configure the loader

```shell
npm i -D @mdx-js/loader
```

```js
configs.rules.push({
  test: /\.mdx$/,
  use: ['babel-loader', '@mdx-js/loader'],
})
```

Test adding a link here: [Crystal Ball Projects](https://github.com/crystal-ball)

- [Syntax Highlighting](https://mdxjs.com/guides/syntax-highlighting)

### Syntax highlighting

The two methods of adding code block syntax highlighting outlined in the MDX docs are:

1. Use the [`@mapbox/rehype-prism`][] rehype plugin. The plugin operates during the build
   and adds 0 weight to the vendor bundle, but the result is more opaque for adding
   additional behavior to rendered React elements.
1. Using the `prism-react-renderer` package with a custom `CodeBlock` component set on the
   MDX provider context. The component operates similar to downshift and will allow for
   additional behaviors to be added into the rendered code, but the packages add `26Kb` to
   the vendor bundle weight after _gzip_!.

# Percy

[Percy](https://docs.percy.io/docs) provides visual regression testing. It is integrated
with Cypress and takes snapshots during acceptance tests.

## Setup

1. Install the dependency: `@percy/cypress`
1. Setup healthcheck in `cypress/plugins/index.js`
1. Import command in `cypress/support/index.js`
1. Get `PERCY_TOKEN` from Percy dashboard and add to CI/CD secrets
1. Add a Dockerfile to `cypress` dir to enable installing additional testing dependencies
   for Cypress and overriding the run command to use Percy
1. The Percy app isn't able to determine the branch for PRs or for Docker runs, Set a
   `PERCY_BRANCH` environment variable to fix.

_See *CI-CD#Providing commit info for Cypress+Percy* for details on parsing out commit
info during workflow runs._
