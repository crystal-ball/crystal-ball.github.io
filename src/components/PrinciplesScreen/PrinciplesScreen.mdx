# Principles

1. _Do less_ - Always strive for simplicity, even if it means duplicating some code until
   the problem area is fully understood. There is nothing more expensive than the wrong
   abstraction.
1. _Explain why_ - Code is never fully self-explaining. Comments should explain why the
   semantically named code elements are being used the way they are.
