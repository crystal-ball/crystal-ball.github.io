# Principles

1. _Do less_ - **Always strive for simplicity**, even if it means duplicating some code
   until the problem area is fully understood. There is nothing more expensive than the
   wrong abstraction. **[Ship small diffs][]** to production for faster and safer
   deployments. Small changes are easier to review fast and easier to debug and roll back
   on failure.
1. _A best practice is best practice until there's a better practice._ Consistency makes
   writing code easier for everyone, but should never be held as dogma. When better
   solutions are found planning to introduce them as the new standard is required.

## Guidelines

1. _Explain why_ - Code is never fully self-explaining. Comments should explain why the
   semantically named code elements are being used the way they are.
1. Continuously deliver small changes. CD is actually a successful combination of:
   - Process encouraging and enabling small changes with feature flags. Small changes are
     easier to review and faster to debug and rollback on failure
   - Effective tests. Tests should inspire confidence that the code works. They are
     resilient and not flaky. Applications should test in isolation and should assert that
     if contract failures occur, they are gracefully handled and alerting is triggered.
   - Useful alerting. In order to know that when a deployment fails, that it failed!
1. _Understand and craft appropriate boundaries_ - Seperate business logic into unit
   testable fns, eg separate logic from thunks event flow management so that thunks can be
   tested asynchronously and app logic can be tested synchronously.

## Standards and conventions

Standards should be enforced with tools, eg ESLint or Jest coverage thresholds.
Conventions should be preferred, with documented motivations.

Enforcing standards automatically makes the entire team more effective by getting code to
the expected level faster, eliminating inconsequential nitpicking from code reviews, and
setting the expectation that code review comments should focus on how the solutions of
some change could potentially be improved, or trade-offs to consider.

## Application architecture Principles

<!-- Notes on architecture principles -->

## Effective testing principles

<!-- Notes on writing effective, stable tests -->

- Focus unit testing on pure fns to maximize code coverage without introducing complex
  setup and mocking test code that needs to be maintained.
- Set unit testing coverage standards for critical application logic, eg Redux or models

  ```javascript
  // Require unit test coverage for Redux logic
  coverageThreshold: {
    'src/dux': {
      branches: 95,
      functions: 95,
      statements: 95,
    },
  },
  ```

Best practice is best practice until there’s a better practice: !Best practices should be driven by motivation! having motivation for doing things allows finding better motivations and allows the codebase to evolve. Recognizing that nothing is perfect, nothing is forever, there is value in saying, “this is the current best”, knowing that you may circle back later and find a better best. Drawing that line lets you align and move forward as a group while allowing room for growth. RFCs are a great way to open the floor for proposals to standards.

Emojis make great context communicators: coding is about communicating ideas, having fun, using emojis to bring fun into repo A codebase isn’t just a set of instructions, it is an expression of ideas, an expression of creation that is shared and must be understood by the entire team. Intent is just as important as effect in communicating in the codebase, and understanding and respecting different viewpoints is critical to creating a cohesive, effective codebase. Strive to effectively communicate the _what_ within the code, communicate the _context_, the _why_ in documentation (guides, comments, etc.)

Be conservative in what you use, be liberal in what you learn
