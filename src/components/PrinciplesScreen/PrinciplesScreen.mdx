# Principles

1. _Do less_ - **Always strive for simplicity**, even if it means duplicating some code
   until the problem area is fully understood. There is nothing more expensive than the
   wrong abstraction. **[Ship small diffs][]** to production for faster and safer
   deployments. Small changes are easier to review fast and easier to debug and roll back
   on failure.
1. _A best practice is best practice until there's a better practice._ Consistency makes
   writing code easier for everyone, but should never be held as dogma. When better
   solutions are found planning to introduce them as the new standard is required.

## Guidelines

1. _Explain why_ - Code is never fully self-explaining. Comments should explain why the
   semantically named code elements are being used the way they are.
1. Continuously deliver small changes. CD is actually a successful combination of:
   - Process encouraging and enabling small changes with feature flags. Small changes are
     easier to review and faster to debug and rollback on failure
   - Effective tests. Tests should inspire confidence that the code works. They are
     resilient and not flaky. Applications should test in isolation and should assert that
     if contract failures occur, they are gracefully handled and alerting is triggered.
   - Useful alerting. In order to know that when a deployment fails, that it failed!
