# Principles

1. _Do less_ - Always strive for simplicity, even if it means duplicating some code until
   the problem area is fully understood. There is nothing more expensive than the wrong
   abstraction.
1. _A best practice is best practice until there's a better practice._ Consistency makes
   writing code easier for everyone, but should never be held as dogma. When better
   solutions are found planning to introduce them as the new standard is required.

## Guidelines

1. _Explain why_ - Code is never fully self-explaining. Comments should explain why the
   semantically named code elements are being used the way they are.
